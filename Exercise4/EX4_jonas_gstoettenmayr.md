# Technical report - Jonas Gstöttenmayr

In this technical report I will write about the synergy between different distributed data processing and analysis technologies and how they can interact with AI and ML applications.

This will be done in five major parts:

- [Analytical processing foundations](#1-analytical-processing-functions)
- Streaming, event processing and CDC
- Implications for AI systems
- Vector databases and new indexing paradigms
- Technical postitioning and future outlook

## 1. Analytical Processing functions

To start out with I will explain the role of data warehouses and analytical engines, before going into a more abstract deep dive into the analytical and transactional processing plane.

### Data warehouses
